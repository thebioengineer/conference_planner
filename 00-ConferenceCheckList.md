## Assemble Organizing Committee

This is a critical step, as who is on the committee will shape much of the work. Biggest thing is to make sure it is understood the commitment that is expected. Assemble a diverse group of people, and start a meeting cadence that works for everyone early on. Missing a meeting here or there happens, but making these meetings should be a priority for committee members. There should be a leader of the committee that makes decisions when there is not consensus.

Meeting in person I found to be much more valuable than phone calls for making decisions and moving the project forward. Plan to at the end of each meeting assign tasks and completion goals. At the beginning of each meeting, review progress and road blocks. I would suggest meeting once or twice a month to start, and increase to every other, and finally every week the month before the conference.

At the first meeting, map out when the high level tasks above need to be completed by. Things always take longer than anticipated, so leave a week or two buffer for tasks. Also do not provide "ample" time for getting a task done, the sooner they are due, the more likely they are to get done.

Last thing, but definitely an important thing, is to start a budget document. Go to the [Budget Planner](01-BudgetPlanner.md) to start planning out costs. This is a living document that needs to be updated as you either validate or invalidate your assumptions. At each step and each committee meeting reviewing this document is important.

    -   [ ] Determine ticket price
    -   [ ] Determine sponsorship goals

-   [ ] Create task time line

## Identify Keynote(s)/Endnote/Panel

This task is somewhat related to the schedule, but a schedule can change based on your decisions with how you want your main talks to go. For 2019, originally we wanted just to do an hour long key note, a panel, then sessions. Obviously that changed.

I would suggest finding a local person to be a keynote, and ask for a topic that is general enough to inspire people. A keynote sets the tone for the rest of the conference, so start reaching out to people early. Also make a member of the committee available to work with your keynotes to develop the talk. Also, instead of a keynote, you can do a panel discussion to cover a wide variety of topics from several different people in a short amount of time. But this requires a moderator and more preparation.

-   [ ] Identify a list of potential keynote's/panel members
-   [ ] Contact

## Rough Schedule

The schedule will partly be shaped by your selections with the keynotes, but getting a rough idea for how to organize the conference will shape later steps, like the CFP. Some key things to figure out are when the actual talks will begin, how long each session will be, do you want a panel or keynote, when and how many lightning talks.

-   [ ] Registration time
-   [ ] Keynote/Panel times
-   [ ] Number of sessions/length/times
-   [ ] Number of keynotes
-   [ ] Lunch
-   [ ] Networking time?

## Find Sponsors

Since the goal of the conference is to maintain an approachable cost, this means finding sponsors. Part of finding sponsors is identifying a) what is for "sale" and b) for how much?. Make sure that it is understood

One key item is to make it clear sponsors will only be getting what is explicitly listed in the sponsor package document. Since conferences can be so reliant on external funding, maintaining good relationships with our sponsors year over year is highly important. Another is to make sure to follow up with sponsors about the transfer of the money and make it clear the expectations surrounding that.

-   [ ] Create sponsor package document
-   [ ] Create and document way to receive money from sponsors -[ ] Do this prior to reaching out to potential sponsors
-   [ ] Create list of potential sponsors
-   [ ] Reach out to potential sponsors
-   [ ] Answer any questions sponsors have
-   [ ] transfer money from Sponsors in a timely manner

## Determine conference Platforms

It may seem a little counter-intuitive to be listing this to do item so low, but in reality, most of what has been listed can all be done in parallel with this. Key thing with planning for the meeting's tech support is to make sure it has the capacity needed based on your schedule and estimated total attendees. Next, figuring out who performs what functions -- it will take different people with different skills.

-   [ ] Scope out alternative platforms (there will be more than one and they need to work together)
    -   [ ] Registration (collecting fees?)
    -   [ ] Video Conferencing (managing participation? managing disruptions if any?
    -   [ ] Recordings (can speakers submit a recording?)
    -   [ ] Real time communication with participants (keeping to the schedule?)
    -   [ ] Processing and posting recordings
    -   [ ] Communicating with participants after the event
    -   [ ] Storage

-   [ ] Permissions and related IP agreements

    -   [ ] Are release forms needed?

-   [ ] Determine additional tasks

## Generate Call For Papers

The Call For Papers details what is being looked for in talks submitted to the conference, and the sorts of lengths of talks. It needs to strike a balance between giving applicants a topic to base their abstract off of, but general enough to have a wide variety of topics. Also, detailing what speakers get by being accepted and what is expected of them is a help as well.

The key is to select a time line with the CFP that is long enough for people to figure out how to respond to the prompt, but short enough to cause urgency. A month seems like a good time length. Have a plan in place for social media etc.

-   [ ] Determine accepted talk topics
-   [ ] Determine accepted talk types (ie. 30 minute talks, lightning, trainings, 20 minutes,...)
-   [ ] Determine benefits for speakers - special accommodations, free admission, assistance in reviewing talks, ...
-   [ ] Determine time line for when CFP opens
-   [ ] Determine time line for when CFP closes
-   [ ] Determine time line for Abstract review
-   [ ] Determine committee assignment on reviewing abstracts
-   [ ] Determine speaker response time (\<1 week is ideal)

## Release CFP, Keynote(s)/Endnote, and Earlybird Ticket Sales

This piece is the first public contact for the conference. Some ways are to use twitter, LinkedIn and Mailchimp. Opening the Earlybird ticket sales also means you need your event software selected. There are many out there, the most common one I have seen is eventbright.

-   [ ] Select Event software
-   [ ] Determine end of Early-bird ticket sales
-   [ ] Determine CFP social media plan
-   [ ] Determine Early-bird social media plan

## Review Abstract submissions and send acceptances

Once the abstracts have been submitted, a short turnaround is best to then get acceptances from speakers and then announce full schedule. To review the abstracts, have several committee members read through each abstract and rate them against several metrics, and list the topics they cover. It is up to the committee to decide those metrics. I also took into account how the talks would mesh into the schedule and diversity.

Let the speakers know if they have been accepted, and only give a week to respond. I gave two weeks and still had to follow up.

-   [ ] Review submissions
-   [ ] Group talks
-   [ ] Determine Accepted talks and reach out
-   [ ] track who has responded

## Release schedule & Announce Speakers

Now that all the speakers have been figured out, the full schedule can be released. Update the website with the relevant information on speakers. Start promoting that the schedule is available

-   [ ] update website
-   [ ] announce

## Social Media "blast"

Now most things have been covered, it is time to promote the conference and keep the energy going. We found that having a plan to highlight each of our speakers provided a lot of content. Repeating yourself and highlighting the keynotes is also good.

Create a plan for twitter, linkedin, and mail chimp with their content. Twitter content can be updated more regularly than linkedin. Mailchimp should probably be only used a few times to keep from annoying people. The plan should contain both posts and the date for which they are planned.

-   [ ] Create Social Media plan
